//This file will essentially contain the configuration for a stratum server.
//There will be a data structure that contains the entire stratum spec and then the server and/or
//client will use that spec to operate off of it.
//
//We will provide some kind of builder for this spec so that it's easy for it to be created (either
//manually, through a spec file or etc).
